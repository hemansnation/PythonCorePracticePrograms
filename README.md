# PythonCorePracticePrograms
Contains Simple codes for Python Core practice like:

1.Tic Tac Toe game without graphics file.

2.Find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Eg. 2001,2002,2003,.....


3.Generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Input: 8
Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

4.Write a function which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
For Eg:
Input: matrix(3,3)
O/P: [[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[2,2,2]]

5.Write a function that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Input: hello world! 123
Output:LETTERS 10 DIGITS 3


6.Write a function to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 
Input: New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
Output: 
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1
